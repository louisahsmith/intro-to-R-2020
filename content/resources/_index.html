<div id="to-start-off" class="section level3">
<h3>To start off:</h3>
<ul>
<li><p><a href="https://www.rstudio.com/online-learning/">Here’s</a> RStudio’s great list of online resources. In particular, there are some more online tutorials <a href="https://rstudio.cloud/learn/primers">here</a>.</p></li>
<li><p><a href="http://hadley.nz">Hadley Wickham</a> is probably the #1 R guru and has written several books about R, which you can read on his website, where you can also learn more about the packages he’s written, including <code>ggplot2</code>.</p></li>
<li><p><a href="http://www.moderndive.com">Here’s</a> another book with a good introduction to data science R, including data visualization.</p></li>
<li><p>Used to SAS or STATA? These guides ( <a href="https://github.com/asnr/sas-to-r/blob/master/README.md">SAS</a> and Stata ( <a href="https://github.com/EconometricsBySimulation/RStata/wiki/Dictionary:-Stata-to-R">1</a> &amp; <a href="http://dss.princeton.edu/training/RStata.pdf">2</a>)) can help you translate from those languages to R.</p></li>
<li><p>Some people love learning R with <a href="https://swirlstats.com">Swirl</a>, which teaches you to code interactively.</p></li>
<li><p>The <code>fivethirtyeight</code> package has a ton of cool <a href="https://cloud.r-project.org/web/packages/fivethirtyeight/vignettes/fivethirtyeight.html">datasets</a> that you can play around with.</p></li>
<li><p>If you’re not understanding an error message, clear your workspace and/or restart RStudio and try again. Does the error still show up? Then try writing a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimal_Working_Example">minimal working example</a>. What does it take to reproduce the error? Is the problem with your data, your code, or both?</p></li>
<li><p>Watch <a href="https://www.rstudio.com/resources/videos/debugging-techniques-in-rstudio/">this video</a> of an expert walk through her process of debugging code (even experts get error messages all the time!).</p></li>
<li><p>It may sound silly, but copying and pasting error messages into Google is usually the fastest way to solve a tricky problem. You will almost certainly end up on the relevant <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/">stack overflow</a> question page, because someone somewhere has experienced the error you’ve encountered.</p></li>
<li><p>Struggling with ggplot? Take a look at this <a href="https://www.rstudio.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/ggplot2-cheatsheet.pdf">cheat sheet</a> or this <a href="http://www.r-graph-gallery.com/all-graphs/">gallery</a>. <a href="http://www.cookbook-r.com/Graphs/">This website</a> is another great resource.</p></li>
<li><p>Ready to make your plots beautiful? Choose your color scheme with the RColorBrewer package. Explore ColorBrewer palettes <a href="http://colorbrewer2.org">here</a>. “Set1” and “Dark2” are favorites for qualitative data and “BuGn” is nice for sequential gradients.</p></li>
<li><p>This <a href="https://www.rstudio.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/rmarkdown-reference.pdf">Rmarkdown cheat sheet</a> is helpful for getting started.</p></li>
</ul>
