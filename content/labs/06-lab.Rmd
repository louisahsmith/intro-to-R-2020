# Functions

You can either download the lab as an RMarkdown file <a href="../../lab-handouts/06-lab.Rmd" download="06-lab.Rmd">here</a>, or copy and paste the code as we go into a `.R` script. Either way, save it into the `06-week` folder where you completed the exercises! Since we worked on file structure this week, put it in a new `labs` folder nested within that folder.

## File paths

We talked this week about making file paths work in R. This is especially important if you're sharing your code with everyone. If you set your working directory via `setwd()` or hard-code another path into your code, it's definitely not going to work on my computer.

A famous blog post about this (well, as famous as blog posts about R can be) can be read [here](https://www.tidyverse.org/blog/2017/12/workflow-vs-script/).

How did you make these file paths work?

```{r, eval = FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(knitr)
nlsy <- read_csv("nlsy.csv")
```

```{r, fig.align="center", eval = FALSE}
# this function adds a static image
include_graphics("figure1.jpg")
```

```{r, eval = FALSE}
read_rds("table1.rds") %>%
  kable() # this function prints nicer tables in R Markdown
```

By the way, you can change the directory in which an R Markdown document is knitted using the arrow by the Knit button. You can also use the settings to change the default. But if you use the `here` package it won't matter what you do!

One thing that is helpful to know when you're working interactively, is how to navigate around file paths. If you need to go *up* a level, you use two dots to do so. So in the code below, we go *down* two levels from the top-level directory, then have to go *up* two levels and *down* two different levels to access the data. See why project directories and the `here` package make everything easier?!
```{r, eval = FALSE}
proj_wd <- getwd()
setwd("figures/super important")
nlsy <- read_csv("../../data/raw/nlsy.csv")
# ahhh take us back to where we started from!
setwd(proj_wd)
```

## Missing data

The `nlsy.csv` file includes all 12,687 participants of the  NLSY-79. Read in the data once without specifying the values that indicate missingness. Explore the data and find them all. Then read in the data again, using the `na = ` argument in `read_csv()` to read them in as NA's. 

```{r}
# skip = 1 means to skip the first row, which were the original col names
nlsy <- read_csv(here::here("data", "raw", "nlsy.csv"), skip = 1, col_names = c(
  "glasses", "eyesight", "sleep_wkdy", "sleep_wknd",
  "id", "nsibs", "samp", "race_eth", "sex", "region",
  "income", "res_1980", "res_2002", "age_bir"
))
```

How can we explore the data to get an idea of what values mean that variable is missing?

```{r}
summary(nlsy)
ggplot(nlsy) +
  geom_histogram(aes(age_bir))
count(nlsy, nsibs)
```

Reread the data with the missing values specified:
```{r}
nlsy <- read_csv(here::here("data", "raw", "nlsy.csv"), skip = 1, 
                 na = c("-998", "-5", "-4", "-3", "-2", "-1"),
                 col_names = c(
  "glasses", "eyesight", "sleep_wkdy", "sleep_wknd",
  "id", "nsibs", "samp", "race_eth", "sex", "region",
  "income", "res_1980", "res_2002", "age_bir"
))
```

Check again to see if anything's off:
```{r}
summary(nlsy)
ggplot(nlsy) +
  geom_histogram(aes(age_bir))
count(nlsy, nsibs)
```
There are certainly some outliers we might want to investigate, but nothing else coded as missing.

(Obviously, these missing values are noted in the data dictionary. You shouldn't have to guess what the missing values are when you're working with real data -- ask someone who knows, instead!)

Now imagine you're interested in how the number of siblings relates to one's age when they have their first child. Create a dataset to study this question:

- Assume that if the number of siblings is missing, they have 0
- Create a variable that is 1 if someone has kids, and 0 otherwise
- Create a dataset containing id, the sibling/child variables of interest, and income. 
- Subset the data to exclude people who are missing income.

```{r}
for_analysis <- nlsy %>%
  mutate(
    nsibs = case_when( # or ifelse(is.na(nsibs), 0, nsibs)
      is.na(nsibs) ~ 0,
      TRUE ~ nsibs
    ),
    has_kids = case_when( # or ifelse(!is.na(age_bir), 1, 0)
      !is.na(age_bir) ~ 1,
      TRUE ~ 0
    )
  ) %>%
  select(id, nsibs, has_kids, age_bir, income) %>%
  filter(!is.na(income))
```
