## Install R and RStudio

First, install R at this link: [https://cran.r-project.org/mirrors.html](https://cran.r-project.org/mirrors.html). Choose a mirror approximately close to you geographically, and then choose the option correspoding to your operating system:

![](img/download-R.png)

Follow all the operating system-specific instructions.

Congratulations! ðŸ¥³ You have R installed! That means you could write an R script and run it. But let's make things a lot easier by downloading RStudio, which will keep us organized and supply us with lots of shortcuts.

You can download RStudio at this link: [https://rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/](https://rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/). Choose the RStudio Desktop free version on the left:

And then the blue download button at the top should match your operating system. If not, you can choose from the list below.

Again follow the instructions for download. Now open up RStudio. It should automatically be connected with R!

## Install the tidyverse package

Open up RStudio. In the **console**, type in `install.packages("tidyverse")` and press enter. Then wait a while. VoilÃ ! You have just installed a lot of super useful packages.

You ran that code in the **console** because it's not something you'll need to run again or look back at. When you are *loading* a package, you'll want to do that from a **script**. You'll want a record of the fact that you loaded the package so that if you or someone else wants to rerun the code, they'll have the appropriate packages.

If you're trying to run code that requires a package you haven't installed, either RStudio will suggest they do so (because RStudio is magical ðŸ§™), or you'll get an error when you run `library(package_name)`. In fact, here's what happens when you try to load that package (which I haven't installed because it doesn't exist!)

```{r}
library(package_name)
```

To open a new R **script**, choose "File" -> "New File" -> "R Script", or simply click on the button with a green plus sign at the upper-left corner of the window. This is a blank document that you can write code in and save to come back to.

In that document, write:
```{r, eval = FALSE}
# load packages
library(tidyverse)
```

The first line is a comment, which won't run when you run the script. Comments in R start with `#` and can include whatever they want after that. To comment out multiple lines, simply preface each one with `#`. (Highlighting them all and using `Cmd`/`Ctrl` + `Shift` + `c` is faster!)

If you highlight both lines, or just put your cursor on the end of the second, and then press `Cmd`/`Ctrl` + `Enter`, the code will run. You should see some text show up in the **console**.

```{r}
# load packages
library(tidyverse)
```
