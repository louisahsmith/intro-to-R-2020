<h2>Install R and RStudio</h2>
<p>First, install R at this link: <a href="https://cran.r-project.org/mirrors.html">https://cran.r-project.org/mirrors.html</a>. Choose a mirror approximately close to you geographically, and then choose the option correspoding to your operating system:</p>
<p><img src="img/download-R.png" /></p>
<p>Follow all the operating system-specific instructions.</p>
<p>Congratulations! 🥳 You have R installed! That means you could write an R script and run it. But let’s make things a lot easier by downloading RStudio, which will keep us organized and supply us with lots of shortcuts.</p>
<p>You can download RStudio at this link: <a href="https://rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/">https://rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/</a>. Choose the RStudio Desktop free version on the left:</p>
<p><img src="img/rstudio-download.png" /></p>
<p>And then the blue download button at the top should match your operating system. If not, you can choose from the list below.</p>
<p><img src="img/rstudio-2.png" /></p>
<p>Again follow the instructions for download. Now open up RStudio. It should automatically be connected with R!</p>

<div id="install-the-tidyverse-package" class="section level2">
<h2>Install the tidyverse package</h2>
<p>Open up RStudio. In the <strong>console</strong>, type in <code>install.packages("tidyverse")</code> and press enter. Then wait a while. Voilà! You have just installed a lot of super useful packages.</p>
<p>You ran that code in the <strong>console</strong> because it’s not something you’ll need to run again or look back at. When you are <em>loading</em> a package, you’ll want to do that from a <strong>script</strong>. You’ll want a record of the fact that you loaded the package so that if you or someone else wants to rerun the code, they’ll have the appropriate packages.</p>
<p>If you’re trying to run code that requires a package you haven’t installed, either RStudio will suggest they do so (because RStudio is magical 🧙), or you’ll get an error when you run <code>library(package_name)</code>. In fact, here’s what happens when you try to load that package (which I haven’t installed because it doesn’t exist!)</p>
<pre class="r"><code>library(package_name)
#&gt; Error in library(package_name): there is no package called &#39;package_name&#39;</code></pre>
<p>To open a new R <strong>script</strong>, choose “File” -&gt; “New File” -&gt; “R Script”, or simply click on the button with a green plus sign at the upper-left corner of the window. This is a blank document that you can write code in and save to come back to.</p>
<p>In that document, write:</p>
<pre class="r"><code># load packages
library(tidyverse)</code></pre>
<p>The first line is a comment, which won’t run when you run the script. Comments in R start with <code>#</code> and can include whatever they want after that. To comment out multiple lines, simply preface each one with <code>#</code>. (Highlighting them all and using <code>Cmd</code>/<code>Ctrl</code> + <code>Shift</code> + <code>c</code> is faster!)</p>
<p>If you highlight both lines, or just put your cursor on the end of the second, and then press <code>Cmd</code>/<code>Ctrl</code> + <code>Enter</code>, the code will run. You should see some text show up in the <strong>console</strong>.</p>
<pre class="r"><code># load packages
library(tidyverse)</code></pre>
