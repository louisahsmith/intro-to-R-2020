<h2>Course Description</h2>
<p>This 6-week, non-credit course will provide an introduction to R to get you up and running with data management and analysis. The lectures, exercises, and programming challenges will provide you with skills, tips, and tricks to make your data tasks easier. The goal is to gain comfort with R, learn some best practices, and take home code you can modify and re-use. We’ll be covering some of the skills considered the most important by Harvard Chan students in a recent survey (see <a href="#fig1">Figure</a>).</p>
<p>You’ll be expected to watch a video lecture every week and complete some exercises on your own. Weekly lab/office hours sessions will be scheduled based on student availability to go over the exercises, work in small groups, and ask and answer questions.</p>
<div id="pre-requisites" class="section level3">
<h3>Pre-requisites</h3>
<p>No experience with R is expected. This course will be appropriate for new users as well as those who have basic familiarity with R but aren’t comfortable conducting their day-to-day data tasks in R. For newcomers, the first lecture will get you up and running. Those who have used R before can skip that lecture and join us the second week.</p>
