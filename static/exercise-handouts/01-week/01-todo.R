#### Code ------------------------------------------------------------
# Run through this code on your own to practice what we covered in
# the slides.

# create a vector of numeric values
vals <- c(1, 645, 329)
vals

# run these lines of code one at a time and compare what each does
# what happens in your environment window? what about your console?
new_vals
c(13, 7245, 23, 49.32)
new_vals <- c(13, 7245, 23, 49.32)
new_vals

# create and view different types of vectors
chars <- c("dog", "cat", "rhino")
chars
logs <- c(TRUE, FALSE, FALSE)
logs

# create a matrix
mat <- matrix(c(234, 7456, 12, 654, 183, 753), nrow = 2)
mat

# pull out rows
mat[2, ]
