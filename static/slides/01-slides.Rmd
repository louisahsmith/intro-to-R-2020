# Packages

- Some functions are built into R
  - `mean()`, `lm()`, `table()`, etc.
- They actually come from built-in packages
  - `base`, `stats`, `graphics`, etc.
- Anyone (yes, *anyone*) build their own package to add to the functionality of R
  - `ggplot2`, `dplyr`, `data.table`, `survival`, etc.

# Packages

.large[
- You have to **install** a package once*

```r
install.packages("survival")
```

- You then have to **load** the package every time you want to use it

```r
library(survival)
```
]
.footnote[*Actually, with every new major R release, but we won't worry about that.]

# Packages


"You only have to buy the book once, but you have to go get it out of the bookshelf every time you want to read it."

```r
install.packages("survival")
library(survival)
survfit(...)
```

# Package details


- When you use `install.packages`, packages are downloaded from [CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org) (The Comprehensive R Archive Network)
  - This is also where you downloaded R
- Packages can be hosted lots of other places, such as [Bioconductor](https://www.bioconductor.org) (for bioinformatics), and [Github](https://www.github.com) (for personal projects or while still developing)
- The folks at CRAN check to make things "work" in some sense, but don't check on the statistical methods...
  - But because R is open-source, you can always read the code yourself
- Two functions from different packages can have the same name... if you load them both, you may have some trouble


---
# tidyverse

- The same people who make RStudio also are responsible for a set of packages called the `tidyverse`

# tidyverse

.large[
.pull-left-wide[
- Running `install.packages(tidyverse)` actually downloads more than a dozen packages*
- Running `library(tidyverse)` loads:
.center[`ggplot2`, `dplyr`, `tidyr`, `readr`, `purrr`, `tibble`, `stringr`, `forcats`]
- This is by no means the only way to manage your data, but I find that a lot of the time, it's the easiest and simplest way to get things done.

- An `.Rproj` file is mostly just a placeholder. It remembers various options, and makes it easy to open a new RStudio session that starts up in the correct working directory. You never need to edit it directly.

- A README file can just be a text file that includes notes for yourself or future users.

- I like to have a folder for raw data -- which I never touch -- and a folder(s) for datasets that I create along the way.

- Each week you'll download a zip file of some or all of the things you need for the week
  - You may be adding more later!
- Open the week's work by opening the `.Rproj` file
  - This will ensure you're in the right working directory to easily access the data, etc.

# R uses `<-` for assignment
.midi[
Create an object `vals` that contains and sequence of numbers:

```{r}
# create values
vals <- c(1, 645, 329)
```

Put your cursor at the end of the line and hit ctrl/cmd + enter.

Now `vals` holds those values.

We can see them again by running just the name (put your cursor after the name and press ctrl/cmd + enter again).

```{r}
vals
```

.go[No assignment arrow means that the object will be printed to the console.]
]

---
# Types of data (*classes*)
.midi[
We could also create a character *vector*:

```{r}
chars <- c("dog", "cat", "rhino")
chars
```

Or a *logical* vector:

```{r}
logs <- c(TRUE, FALSE, FALSE)
logs
```

.go[We'll see more options as we go along!]
]

---

# Types of objects
.midi[
We created *vectors* with the `c()` function (`c` stands for concatenate)

We could also create a *matrix* of values with the `matrix()` function:
```{r}
# turn the vector of numbers into a 2-row matrix
mat <- matrix(c(234, 7456, 12, 654, 183, 753), nrow = 2)
mat
```

The numbers in square brackets are *indices*, which we can use to pull out values:

```{r}
# extract second row
mat[2, ]
```
]

---
# Dataframes

We usually do analysis in R with dataframes (or some variant).

Dataframes are basically like spreadsheets: columns are variables, and rows are observations.
```{r}
gss_cat
```

```
```{r, comment = NA, echo = FALSE}
as.data.frame(gss_cat)[1:20, 1:4]
```
]

# and tibbles are the quickest and most intuitive way to make and read a dataset
.pull-left[
```{r}
dat1 <- tibble(
  age = c(24, 76, 38),
  height_in = c(70, 64, 68),
  height_cm = height_in * 2.54
